Mean infections
If the simulation indicates no
infected people,then there is
nothing shown on the map.
The infected people (simulation
mean)is the mean of the 4
simulation runs which indicate
the potential number of
 infected people in each area.
The coefficient of variance
(CoV) show how much
ROIT
uncertainty there is in the data
The higher the figure, the less
certain the simulation output.
