Each circle represents a 'cell' with a given population.
The size indicates the impact measured in proportion of infections per cell.
The colour indicates levels of certainty. Darker shades are associated with higher levels of certainty.
However over specific cells for more information.
Interpretation: SElecting 'Very High' and 'Almost Certain' categories displays
cells with simulated 50% or more infected with certainty of about 93%
