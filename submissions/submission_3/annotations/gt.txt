Note that:
1. Impact is defined as the mean number of infections.
Infection Rate
2. Standard Deviation (S.D.) is the average difference from the mean. The Coefficient of Variation (C.o.V.) is the
proportion of the mean that this difference represents. They are measures of uncertainty.
0.03%
100.00%
3. Low uncertainty is defined as having a C.o.V. under 0.25, and medium uncertainty as between 0.25 and 0.50.
Anything at 0.50 and above is considered high.
4. Minimum and Maximum estimates are calculated using the C.o.V. and as such are the likely minimum and maximum
estimates.
5. The colour gradient on the map and graphs uses Rate of Infection (percentage of population infected) as its scale.
